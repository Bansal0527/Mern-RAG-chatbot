# Large Language Model (LLM) Usage in the MERN RAG Chatbot

This document details the specific areas and mechanisms through which Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized within the Knowledge Management Platform.

## 1. Core Functionality: Conversational AI Interface (Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG)

The primary and most critical use of LLMs in this project is to power the conversational AI interface through a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. This ensures that AI responses are accurate, relevant, and grounded in the organization's specific knowledge base, minimizing hallucinations.

### 1.1. RAG Workflow Steps:

When a user submits a query in the chat interface, the following steps involving LLMs occur:

1.  **Query Embedding**: The user's natural language query is first transformed into a numerical vector (embedding) using an embedding model provided by the LLM provider (e.g., Google Gemini's embedding capabilities). This allows for semantic comparison with document content.

2.  **Document Retrieval**: The generated query embedding is used to perform a similarity search against the vector store (e.g., FAISS). This process retrieves the most semantically relevant document chunks from the ingested knowledge base. These chunks are the "retrieved" part of RAG.

3.  **Contextual Prompt Construction**: The retrieved document chunks are then combined with the original user query to form a comprehensive prompt. This prompt explicitly provides the LLM with the necessary context to generate an informed response. A typical prompt structure might look like:

    ```
    Based on the following information:

    [Retrieved Document Chunk 1]
    [Retrieved Document Chunk 2]
    ...

    Answer the following question: [User's Query]
    ```

4.  **Response Generation**: The constructed prompt is sent to the main generative LLM (e.g., Google Gemini). The LLM processes this augmented prompt and generates a coherent, natural language response that directly addresses the user's question, drawing information primarily from the provided document chunks. This is the "augmented generation" part.

5.  **Source Citation (Stretch Goal)**: If implemented, the LLM's response can be further processed to identify which specific document chunks or documents contributed to the answer, allowing for source citations to be displayed to the user.

### 1.2. Benefits of RAG for Conversational AI:

-   **Accuracy**: Responses are based on factual information from the provided documents, reducing the likelihood of incorrect or fabricated answers.
-   **Relevance**: The retrieval mechanism ensures that only information pertinent to the user's query is considered by the LLM.
-   **Up-to-date Information**: The knowledge base can be continuously updated by ingesting new documents, allowing the AI to provide current information without retraining the entire LLM.
-   **Reduced Hallucinations**: By grounding the LLM's responses in specific documents, the tendency for the model to generate plausible but false information is significantly reduced.

## 2. Potential Future LLM Applications (Stretch Goals/Enhancements)

While the core focus is RAG for chat, LLMs could be extended to other areas:

-   **Automated Document Summarization**: LLMs could be used to generate concise summaries of uploaded documents, aiding quick understanding.
-   **Metadata Extraction**: Beyond basic filename and size, LLMs could extract more complex metadata (e.g., key topics, entities, sentiment) from documents.
-   **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: By analyzing user queries and the retrieved documents, LLMs could help identify areas where the knowledge base is lacking or where information is frequently sought but not easily found.
-   **Conversation Memory and Context Synthesis**: LLMs could be used to maintain conversation context across multiple turns or sessions, synthesizing previous interactions to provide more cohesive responses.
-   **Different Conversation Modes**: LLMs could be prompted to operate in different modes (e.g., research, summary, Q&A) by adjusting the system prompt and context provided.
