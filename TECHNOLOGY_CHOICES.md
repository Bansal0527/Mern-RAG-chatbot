# Technology Choices Justification

This document outlines the key technology choices made for the MERN RAG Chatbot project and provides a brief justification for each.

## 1. Overall Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

-   **Justification**: The MERN stack is a popular and robust choice for full-stack web development. It offers a unified JavaScript/TypeScript environment across the frontend and backend, simplifying development, improving code reusability, and reducing context switching for developers. Its component-based architecture (React) and scalable backend (Node.js) are well-suited for modern web applications.

## 2. Backend Technologies

### 2.1. Node.js with Express.js

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Python (FastAPI/Django), TypeScript (NestJS)
-   **Justification**: Node.js is chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it highly efficient for I/O-bound operations typical of API services (e.g., handling many concurrent requests, database interactions, external API calls to LLMs). Express.js provides a minimalist and flexible framework for building robust APIs quickly. The existing codebase already uses Node.js/Express, making it a natural continuation.

### 2.2. MongoDB

-   **Alternative Considerations**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
-   **Justification**: MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, offers flexibility in schema design, which is beneficial for a project that might evolve its data structures (e.g., document metadata, chat message formats). Its scalability and ability to handle large volumes of data make it suitable for a knowledge management platform. It integrates seamlessly with Node.js applications.

### 2.3. `jsonwebtoken` (JWT) for Authentication

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Session-based authentication
-   **Justification**: JWTs provide a stateless authentication mechanism, which is ideal for scalable API services. The server does not need to store session information, reducing server load and simplifying horizontal scaling. JWTs are widely adopted, secure when implemented correctly, and allow for easy integration with frontend frameworks.

### 2.4. `multer` for File Uploads

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Custom file handling, other middleware
-   **Justification**: `multer` is a popular Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. It simplifies the process of parsing incoming file data, making it easy to integrate document upload functionality securely and efficiently.

### 2.5. `pdf-parse` and `mammoth` for Document Parsing

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Other parsing libraries, external services
-   **Justification**: These libraries provide robust capabilities for extracting text content from PDF and DOCX files, respectively. This is a critical component for ingesting diverse document formats into the knowledge base, enabling the RAG system to process and understand the content.

### 2.6. `langchain` and `@google/generative-ai` for LLM Integration

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Direct API calls, other LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
-   **Justification**: `langchain` provides a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. It simplifies the orchestration of complex LLM workflows, such as RAG, by offering abstractions for document loading, text splitting, embedding, and chain creation. `@google/generative-ai` is chosen for direct integration with Google's Gemini models, aligning with the project's potential need for advanced generative capabilities and potentially cost-effective solutions.

### 2.7. FAISS (via `faiss-node`) for Vector Store

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, custom implementation
-   **Justification**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. Using `faiss-node` allows for a local, in-memory vector store, which is suitable for initial development and smaller-scale deployments, avoiding the overhead of external vector database services. It provides fast retrieval of relevant document chunks, crucial for the RAG process.

## 3. Frontend Technologies

### 3.1. React.js

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Vue.js, Angular, vanilla JavaScript
-   **Justification**: React is a widely adopted JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its declarative syntax, component-based architecture, and efficient DOM updates. Its large community, extensive ecosystem, and strong performance characteristics make it an excellent choice for developing complex and interactive single-page applications like this platform.

### 3.2. Tailwind CSS

-   **Alternative Considerations**: Bootstrap, custom CSS, Styled Components
-   **Justification**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by providing low-level utility classes directly in the markup. This approach promotes consistency, reduces the need for writing custom CSS, and speeds up the design process, allowing developers to build complex UIs quickly and efficiently.

### 3.3. `react-router-dom` for Routing

-   **Justification**: `react-router-dom` is the standard library for declarative routing in React applications. It provides a robust and flexible way to manage navigation, define routes, and handle URL parameters, essential for a multi-page application with distinct sections like dashboard, login, and chat.

### 3.4. Radix UI Components

-   **Justification**: Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible components that can be easily customized with Tailwind CSS. This allows for building high-quality, accessible UI elements (like buttons, forms, and dialogs) without sacrificing design flexibility, ensuring a good user experience and adherence to accessibility standards.
